Work in progress - doesn't work reliably.

Running on windows 10

Install the latest docker toolbox from:
https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases

Start docker through the desktop icon, it should open a terminal

Download basicswap
https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/archive/master.zip

Extract it.

Navigate to the docker folder.


If you have an existing litecoin chain, copy the contents of your datadir excluding litecoin.conf and any wallets to coindata/litecoin
If your litecoin chain is pruned create a new wallet in the existing datadir to avoid having to resync the chain.


Right click -> properties on the coindata folder, in the security tab make sure all users have 'Modify' rights.


Run the script: dockerbuild.bat

It should open a new terminal window and start building the container.

Once that completes run: dockerup.bat

In the terminal that opened for docker toolbox, find the line:
docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100

And open the ip address it displays at port 12700 in a browser:
192.168.99.100:12700

Should show some html.

Now go to the view wallets page, and wait for all chains to completely sync.
